        Our research focuses on embodied intelligence in robotics, with special emphasis on humanoid and legged systems. At our lab, we're pushing the boundaries of embodied intelligence in robotics, with a special focus on humanoid and legged systems. Our interdisciplinary approach combines cutting-edge research in motion planning, machine learning, computer vision, and biomechanics to create robots that can navigate and interact with the world as naturally as living beings. We're tackling the complex challenges of dynamic stability, adaptive locomotion, and real-time decision-making in unstructured environments.
