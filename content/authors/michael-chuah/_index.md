Michael Chuah is a Senior Scientist in the Robotics & Autonomous Systems department where he leads a team in developing capabilities for quadruped robots. Their focus is on using learning-based methods for perceptual locomotion and terrain-awareness, enabling legged robots to safely and robustly navigate both urban areas and unstructured outdoor environments.

Dr. Chuah obtained his B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). He completed his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Mechanical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), working with Prof. Sangbae Kim in the MIT Biomimetic Robotics Lab.

Dr. Chuah's research interest lies at the intersection of legged locomotion, force sensing and control, as well as reinforcement learning; with the goal of enabling quadruped robots to perform tasks in all-terrain with minimal supervision, so as to help solve national challenges in areas such as landscape maintenance, patrolling, and security.
